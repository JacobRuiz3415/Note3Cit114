##Key points
- AWS region are geographical area that hold infrastructure to hosted the cloud. 
- For selecting the best AWS region, you need to consider many things, such as what services are available in that region, .the cost, latency, and what are the service level agreements there.
- Within regions, there are availability zone, and these are multiple and more date centers
- AWS is fault tolerant meaning operations can continue even when one component fails.
- AWS Local zone try to deploy the AWS cloud closer to the users.
- The number of edge location is greater then Availability Zones.
- Data centers consists of many interlocking computers clusters for computing power.
- they need to scale up for computer.These machines are known as servers racks, where specialize hardware called blades to together. 
-These clusters require ton of power, and they need extensive cooling.
-This is where AWS is powered.
-AWS have four foundational services, compute, storage, databases, and Networking.
-Now, there 25 services provided by AWS.
##Quote
- “Costs of the AWS Services can be different for each region because the cost, taxes, manpower, etc for the physical infrastructure and data centers are different from Region to Region. For example, an m3. large EC2 instance cost in EU Frankfurt is $119.52, whereas the same instance in US N.Virginia will cost you $100.8, more than 10% less. So you should review and compare the costs of the AWS region where you have chosen to deploy your workloads.”
- "In a nutshell, endpoints are specific URLs that act as an entry point for a web service, and many AWS services will have an endpoint based on its region/AZ. Endpoints aim to reduce further the latency of your applications, but not all AWS services support endpoints with regions/AZ data in the naming convention."
##New facts
- A single Data Center might easily hold 10,000 racks each with 100 blades
- There are 410+ Points of Presence.
- For MLL, the sequencing of DNA produces petadate of data.
